	- Added new header and C files config.h and config.c allowing nettapus to now
	read a configuration file on boot to load settings. The settings loaded
	from this file will grow over time, but I do plan on hardcoding defaults in
	case the file isn't found. The system just loads variables from the file,
	each system component is responsible for asking for the appropriate variables
	and also having default values in case the user doesn't specify them.
	This takes care of one of the TODOs.

	- Fixed various instances of undefined behaviour in the kernel. This ranges
	from the NULL-ptr usage in the VMM, to the various out-of-bounds shifts in
	the PMM, to a wrong mapping in (again) the VMM. Also added an option to
	the Makefile to compile with ubsan has been added.

	- A serial driver has been added, in order to ease debugging. Various
	debug messages will be added over time. The driver cannot accept input, it's
	more of a debug output for now. Also, this takes care of one of the TODOs.

	- A mysterious bug where resetting QEMU from the toolbar after running
	Nettapus caused Nettapus to behave unexpectedly. This most likely resulted
	from one of the UBs that was fixed.

	- Fixed multiple bugs in the ext2 driver that resulted in the wrong calculation of
	a directory entry's name length. (I don't even know how I managed to screw
	that up in the first place).
