# nettapus
A beginner's OS project. Made to learn about OS development. As of now, it does not contain anything of interest or use. You can use the build script to get an image you can run on qemu, as well as real hardware. The clean script will clean everything. Quite simple, huh?

# dependencies
This project requires you to have a i686 gcc cross compiler, assembler, archiver and linker (gcc, as, ar and ld respectively) to build. Otherwise you cna build it yourself as well, of course.

Yeah, this project's still pretty immature as of now. Any contribution is really appreciated.
