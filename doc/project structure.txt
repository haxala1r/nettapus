This file is here to document what each folder in the src/ directory is purposed
for.

every path is relative to the project's root.

src/kernel is where every kernel source that is compiled into the kernel is kept.
kernel modules etc. don't count, as they are not compiled into the kernel. In
the future, when there are proper modules to speak of, they will probably go in
src/modules

src/usr is where userspace applications, their sources etc. go. Everything here
has its own build script, simply because it wouldn't be feasible to fit everything
inside a single makefile.

These sources are built with a build shell script instead of a make file.

src/usr/bin is where the sources for root/bin are kept.

src/usr/lib is where the library sources for root/lib are kept.
